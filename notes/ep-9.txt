* block scope and shoadowing *

the multiple line code wrapped together in culrly bracrs {}
is called block 





#block scope -->

let and const are block scoped so ther are kept in special memory block

once block ends thne block memory disapper and we cant access anymore 
which means we can only access variables only  inside the block we cant access outside the block





#shoadowing--->

#shoadowing with var -

when we declare variable with var then it cant crrate special memory for that insted of it it overwrite in global scope 



#shoadowing with const and let 

-the let and const are block scoped means wheneven we declare variables they create special memory so the 
valur of inner and outside variable is diffrent





#illegal shoadowing  -->
