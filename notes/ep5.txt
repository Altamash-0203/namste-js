5-shortest js program , widoow and this keyword =====>


➤When you run even an empty JavaScript file, a lot is happening behind the scenes. The JavaScript engine creates something called the Global Execution Context (GEC),
 which is the environment where the code will run. This includes memory space and other necessary settings.

➤In browsers, JavaScript also creates a special object called window. The window object holds many built-in functions and variables (like alert, console, etc.) 
 that you can use anywhere in your code.

➤JavaScript also creates a special variable called this. At the global level (outside of functions), this refers to the window object.

➤In different environments, like Node.js, this global object has a different name (not window).

➤In browsers, at the global level, this === window means that the this keyword is the same as the window object.

➤So, even in an empty JavaScript file, the engine sets up important things like the global execution context, the global object (window), and the this keyword.

➤If we create any variable in the global scope, then the variables get attached to the global
object.
