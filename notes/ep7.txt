1. What is Scope?
    Scope determines where variables and functions can be used in your code.
    There are two main types of scope:
    Global Scope: Variables that can be accessed from anywhere in your code.
    Local Scope: Variables that are only accessible within a specific function.

2. Lexical Environment:
    Each function or block has its own Lexical Environment (local memory) where variables are stored.
    It also has a reference to its parent environment, forming a chain.
    Lexical Environment = Local memory + Parent reference.

4. Scope Chain:
    If a function can’t find a variable, it looks in its parent scope, then the global scope.
    This process is called the scope chain.   



Key Point:Inner functions can access outer variables, but variables inside a function can’t be accessed from outside.
