/*
--->Memory Allocation Phase:
  In the first phase, JavaScript assigns each variable a placeholder value called undefined.


-->What is undefined?
undefined means memory has been allocated for the variable, but no value has been assigned yet.


-->Not Declared = Not Defined:
If a variable is not declared during memory allocation and you try to access it, you'll get a Not Defined error.


--->Difference Between Not Defined and Undefined:

Undefined: Variable is declared but has no value yet.
Not Defined: Variable is not declared at all.




##Example:##

console.log(x); // undefined (x is declared but no value yet)
var x = 25;
console.log(x); // 25 (x now has a value)
console.log(a); // Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined (a is not declared)


--->JavaScript is Loosely Typed:

JS does not attach a specific data type to variables.
You can declare a variable as a number, then later change it to a boolean or string.


##Example##

var a = 5;
a = true; // Now 'a' is a boolean
a = 'hello'; // Now 'a' is a string
