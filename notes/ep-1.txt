➤Everything in JS happens inside the execution context.  

➤In the context the first component is memory component and the 2nd one is code component  

➤The memory component in programming is like a storage box that holds all the variables and functions.
  This collection of key-value pairs is called the Variable Environment.

    For example:

                If you have let x = 5, the key is x and the value is 5.
                If you have a function greet(), the key is greet and the value is the actual code inside the function.

➤The code component is where your code runs, one line at a time. It's like a worker 
  that reads and executes each instruction step by step. This process is called the Thread of Execution.


➤JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language, which means:
     Synchronous: It runs one task at a time in the order they appear.
     It waits for each task to finish before moving to the next one.
     Single-threaded: It has only one main worker or thread, so it can do only one thing at a time.
